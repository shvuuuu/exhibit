# Test and go live (/disputes/test-go-live)



Implement and validate the PayPal Disputes API in sandbox and live environments as a developer or QA engineer.

## Simulate test scenarios [#simulate-test-scenarios]

Before going live, you can use the PayPal sandbox environment to test the Disputes API integration. This ensures it works as expected and meets all business and technical requirements.

### Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

1. Ensure you set up the sandbox environment.
2. Ensure you set up buyer-side credentials in the sandbox environment. This is required to create disputes or change dispute reasons as a buyer.

### Simulate buyer actions [#simulate-buyer-actions]

Before testing dispute responses for your integration, you need to simulate buyer actions to create the disputes and transactions in the sandbox environment.

**Create transaction**

To create a transaction in the sandbox environment, do these steps:

1. Log in to your sandbox personal account as a buyer.
2. Select **Send and Request** and follow the on-page instructions to send money to your sandbox business account's email ID.

> **Note:** For a transaction to be eligible for chargeback, ensure you use a credit card to send money.

3. Select **Go to Summary**.
4. In the **Recent activity** section, select the transaction.
5. On the **Summary** page, copy the **Transaction ID**. Use this value to create a dispute.

**Create dispute**

You can create disputes as a buyer using this endpoint and test how to handle them in the sandbox environment.

> **Note:** This is a sandbox-only endpoint. You cannot use it to create disputes in the live environment.

Use a valid access token, include the PayPal-Auth-Assertion request header with a valid JWT, and make a `POST` call to the `/v1/customer/disputes` endpoint. Include the following parameters:

    }
  ]
}
```

A successful call returns an HTTP `200 OK` status code and a HATEOAS link to the dispute. If money movement for the offer is delayed due to internal reasons, the call returns an HTTP `202 Accepted` status code instead.

**Deny offer to resolve dispute**

The customer denies a merchant's offer to resolve a dispute, by ID.

Use a valid access token and make a `POST` call to the `/v1/customer/disputes/{id}/deny-offer` endpoint. Include the following parameter:

| Parameter                    | Description                                                                                               | Action                                 |

### Test dispute scenarios [#test-dispute-scenarios]

You can use the scenarios in this section to test how your integration handles disputes and chargebacks in the sandbox environment.

**Test internal disputes**

You can test internal disputes by creating a dispute for a transaction with PayPal. The dispute can be for payments made using a card, bank account, digital wallet, or other supported payment methods.

**Test data condition**: Use `OTHER` as the evidence type when you provide evidence.

### Test merchant response [#test-merchant-response]

You can test and determine how to respond to disputes using different scenarios. This ensures that your integration correctly handles the merchant actions during the dispute process.

**Key terms**:

* **INR**: Item Not Received
* **SNAD**: Significantly Not As Described

#### Check response due date and HATEOAS links [#check-response-due-date-and-hateoas-links]

You can use the Show dispute details response to determine how and when to respond to disputes.

| Test steps                                                                                                            | Expected outcome                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buyer**: Log in to your sandbox personal account and create an INR case.**Merchant**: Retrieve the dispute details. | The API returns a `200 OK` response. It includes `status`, `seller_response_due_date`, and `links` parameters that help you respond appropriately within the timeframe. |

#### Inquiry stage [#inquiry-stage]

You can use the procedures in this section to test dispute response handling during the inquiry stage.

**Send message to other party**

You can test sending a message to the buyer during the inquiry stage of a dispute. For example, when a buyer creates an INR or SNAD case for a completed transaction, you can send a message to the buyer directly and help resolve the issue before it escalates.

| Test steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Expected outcome                                                                                                          |

#### Appeal dispute [#appeal-dispute]

When PayPal adjudicates a case against a party, you or the buyer may be eligible to appeal the decision. PayPal uses predefined rules to determine appeal eligibility.

To test appeals, create a buyer account with a primary email address that includes `allowappeal` (for example, [testallowappeal@personal.example.com](mailto:testallowappeal@personal.example.com)). The disputes created with this account will trigger:

* The seller appeal workflow if you are found liable.
* The buyer appeal workflow if the buyer is found liable.

> **Note:** Each party can submit only one appeal per case.

To simulate cases where appeals are not allowed for a buyer, create a buyer account with a primary email address that includes `noappeal` (for example, [testnoappeal@personal.example.com](mailto:testnoappeal@personal.example.com)).

You can appeal the case and provide evidence using these evidence types.

**PROOF_OF_FULFILLMENT**

If the case is resolved in the buyer's favor, you can appeal by providing the fulfillment information for INR, unauthorized, or other cases.

### Escalation simulation [#escalation-simulation]

To simulate the day of escalation in the sandbox environment, use the following transaction amounts:

| Transaction amount (USD) | Simulated escalation day |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 5.00 – 5.99              | Day 5 escalation         |
| 9.00 – 9.99              | Day 9 escalation         |
| ≥ 11.00                  | Day 11 escalation        |

Create a transaction with one of the listed amounts, then use that transaction when creating the dispute to simulate the corresponding escalation day.

### Applicable dispute reasons [#applicable-dispute-reasons]

Accelerated Response currently applies to these dispute reasons:

* `MERCHANDISE_OR_SERVICE_NOT_AS_DESCRIBED`
* `MERCHANDISE_OR_SERVICE_NOT_RECEIVED`

Once the dispute is created, you can perform any of the actions listed under the [Inquiry stage](/api/disputes#understand-dispute-lifecycle-stages) section.

## Applicable document proofs [#applicable-document-proofs]

Refer to the applicable documentation requirements in [Supported file types and sizes](/disputes/supported-file-sizes-types).

## Test webhooks [#test-webhooks]

### Test API calls: use test values and simulate responses [#test-api-calls-use-test-values-and-simulate-responses]

To simulate Disputes API responses, inject test values as a path or query parameter in the request URL. These methods allow you to trigger specific error responses without creating actual disputes.

#### Sample - test value as path parameter

| Path parameter                    | Simulated error response |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/v1/customer/disputes/ERRDIS015` | `FORBIDDEN`              |

Sample request

Sample response

```shell
curl -X GET https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/customer/disputes/ERRDIS015 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

```json
{
    "name": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "No permission for the requested operation",
    "debug_id": "e90ec082e0e4d"
}
```

#### Sample - test value as query parameter

| Query parameter                                           | Simulated error response |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/v1/customer/disputes?disputed_transaction_id=ERRDIS023` | `FORBIDDEN`              |

Sample request

Sample response

```shell
curl -X GET https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/customer/disputes?disputed_transaction_id=ERRDIS023 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

```json
{
    "name": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "No permission for the requested operation",
